This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a seperate process.
This project can be completed on any Linux, UNIX, or Mac os X system.

A shell interface gives a user a prompt, after which the next command is entered.
The example below illustrates the promp osh> and the user's next command; cat prog.c.
(This command displays the file prog.c on the terminal using the UNIX cat command.)


osh> cat prog.c
